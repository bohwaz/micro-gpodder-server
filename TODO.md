Would be nice:
* Implement feed URL normalization (update_urls)
* Implement device sync API
* Provide a real app-password for NextCloud API
* Handle subscriptions per device (on Subscriptions API)

In the far future:
* Provide a nice front-end to the web UI
* Manage and play podcasts from the web UI
* Move testing to Makefile
